# **App Name**: GeoCalc AI

## Core Features:

- Scientific Calculator UI: Provides a sleek, responsive interface with toggle between basic and advanced scientific functions and light/dark theme support.
- AI Math Support: Uses Gemini AI to respond to complex mathematical and scientific questions using a chat interface and using LaTeX for displaying the math results. Acts as a tool and decides whether to incorporate some piece of information in its output, and to call Wolfram Alpha if necessary.
- Map Calculator: Calculate distances, areas, and elevation differences between dropped pins on a map (using the Mapbox API for an open-source solution).
- History and Sharing: Stores a history of calculations, AI chats, and map results locally, and provides options for saving and sharing results as PDF or screenshot.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and precision.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and modern look (light theme).
- Accent color: Analogous, slightly desaturated violet (#8560F4) to draw attention to key functions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, clean, and readable interface.
- Use minimalist icons in the style of Material Design for calculator functions.
- Employ a neumorphic design style with soft shadows and inset elements to create a tactile and modern feel.
- Use subtle, animated transitions when toggling between calculator modes and displaying results.
